I downloaded Smart SVN from the torotise SVN site (this version is for Mac). 
I was unable to use the Smart SVN to checkout my repository, we were having issues with "PROPPATCH error". 
All of my documents and edits were done online in GitHub.
I will try to fix these issues but for now will be doing everything in Git.
